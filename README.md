# adb-to-usb

Manufacturing information for my Apple Desktop Bus to USB keyboard converters.

These designs should not be considered supported and many of them didn't make it
past an initial prototype. However, where I include further documentation, it
may be possible to successfully manufacture the boards.

The firmware for these boards is available at
